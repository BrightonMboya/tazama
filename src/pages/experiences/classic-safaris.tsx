            Envision a safari where every day is a journey through some of
            Africa's most renowned and wildlife-rich habitats. Our 5-day
            itinerary is thoughtfully crafted to showcase the diverse beauty of
            the Serengeti, the marvels of the Ngorongoro Crater, and the hidden
            gems of Tarangire National Park. Whether you're basking in the
            golden sunsets of the Serengeti, witnessing the grandeur of
            Ngorongoro's natural amphitheater, or exploring the elephant-dotted
            landscapes of Tarangire, this safari promises a parade of
            unforgettable moments.

          <p className="mb-3 mt-5 text-xl text-[#757371]">
            The Classic Safari is a celebration of nature's wonders. In the
            Serengeti, watch as the savannah comes alive with the Great
            Migration, a spectacle of life in its most unfiltered form. In the
            Ngorongoro Crater, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, encounter a diverse
            array of species, from the elusive black rhino to the pink-hued
            flamingos adorning the soda lakes. Tarangire, with its
            baobab-studded landscapes and dense elephant population, offers a
            quieter, yet equally captivating wildlife viewing experience.
