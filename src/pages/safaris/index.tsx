            Tanzania is renowned for its stunning landscapes, rich biodiversity,
            and abundant wildlife, making it the ultimate destination for safari
            enthusiasts. You wonâ€™t find paved roads or fences in our national
            parks. Some of the most iconic wildlife sceneries call Tanzania
            home. From the Serengeti to Ngorongoro Crater to the hidden gems of
            Tarangire and Selous (Nyerere National Park), Tanzania's national
            parks offer a kaleidoscope of experiences waiting to be explored.
