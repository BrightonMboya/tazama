              Mount Kilimanjaro, standing as a beacon of challenge and
              transformation, calls to adventurers seeking to push their limits
              and experience the profound beauty of the world's tallest

              to Kilimanjaro's summit is not just about reaching the peak but
              doing so safely, with memories of awe-inspiring landscapes, not

              Common Injuries and How to Prevent Them
            </h3>
            <p className="mb-3 mt-5 text-lg text-darker/85">
              Climbing Kilimanjaro can expose adventurers to a variety of
              physical challenges, from the rugged terrain to the thinning air.
              Common injuries include blisters, ankle sprains, muscle strains,
              and sunburn, among others. To embark on this journey with
              confidence, it's essential to prepare your body and mind for the
              mountain's demands.

              Embark on a Tailored Training Regimen
            </h3>
            <p className="mb-3 mt-5 text-lg text-darker/85">
              Preparation is key to a successful and injury-free climb. Start
              your training at least two months before your expedition, focusing
              on strengthening your legs and upper body, enhancing flexibility,
              and increasing your lung capacity. At Tazama, we recommend
              incorporating strength training, stretching, and hike training
              into your regimen. Embrace the outdoors, familiarize yourself with
              your gear, and simulate Kilimanjaro's conditions as closely as
              possible.

              Choose Your Footwear Wisely
            </h3>
            <p className="mb-3 mt-5 text-lg text-darker/85">
              Your feet are your foundation on Kilimanjaro, and selecting the
              right footwear is critical. Ensure your boots or trail shoes are
              well-fitted, offer robust traction, and are waterproof to keep
              your feet dry. Consider investing in liner socks or toe socks to
              minimize friction and prevent blisters, safeguarding your steps as
              you ascend toward the clouds.

              Trekking Poles: Your Kilimanjaro Companions
            </h3>
            <p className="mb-3 mt-5 text-lg text-darker/85">
              Trekking poles are invaluable tools on the mountain, providing
              stability, reducing the load on your legs, and aiding in balance.
              They're especially beneficial during descents, when the risk of
              slipping or straining muscles increases. Let your poles become
              extensions of your body, enhancing your rhythm and steadiness as
              you navigate Kilimanjaro's diverse terrains.

              Shield Yourself from the Sun
            </h3>
            <p className="mb-3 mt-5 text-lg text-darker/85">
              The equatorial sun on Kilimanjaro can be relentless. Protect your
              skin with high-SPF sunscreen, reapplying regularly, and wear
              protective clothing. Consider spending time in shaded areas during
              rest breaks to avoid overexposure. Your health and comfort are
              paramount, and at Tazama, we're committed to ensuring you're
              well-prepared to face the sun's intensity.

              Acclimatization: The Key to Avoiding Altitude Sickness
            </h3>
            <p className="mb-3 mt-5 text-lg text-darker/85">
              Altitude sickness can affect climbers of all fitness levels, but
              gradual acclimatization can significantly reduce the risk. By
              choosing a route that allows for a "climb high, sleep low"
              approach, you give your body the time it needs to adjust to the
              thinner air. Listen to your body, move at a pace that allows for
              proper breathing, and stay hydrated.
