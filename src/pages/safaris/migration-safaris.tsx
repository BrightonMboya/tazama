            Embark on the Migration Safari, an extraordinary journey with Tazama
            Africa Safaris, to witness one of nature’s most awe-inspiring
            spectacles. The Great Migration, a monumental movement of over two
            million wildebeest, zebras, and gazelles, is a display of nature’s
            raw power and beauty, a phenomenon that captures the essence of the
            wild African landscape.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 mt-5 text-lg text-darker/85">
            The Migration Safari offers an unparalleled opportunity to observe
            this majestic event. Each year, around 1.5 million wildebeest and
            200,000 zebras embark on an epic 1,800-mile circuit through the
            Ngorongoro Conservation Area, the vast plains of the Serengeti, and
            into Kenya's Maasai Mara. This journey, driven by instinct and the
            pursuit of sustenance, is one of the world’s most incredible natural
            wonders.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3 mt-5 text-lg text-darker/85">
            As the herds follow the rains, you’ll witness nature’s drama unfold.
            Predators, including lions, cheetahs, and crocodiles, lie in wait,
            turning the migration into a struggle for survival. Each stage of
            the journey presents its own challenges – treacherous river
            crossings, steep embankments, and endless plains. It’s a testament
            to the resilience of these creatures, an unfolding story of life,
            struggle, and survival.

        <p className="mt-5 text-xl text-primary">
          RIVER CROSSING ITINERARY JULY - NOVEMBER
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3 mt-5 text-lg text-darker/85">
          The river crossings, considered by many the most exciting event of the
          Great Migration, usually start in July, depending on the rains. The
          herds can be found in the Northern Serengeti as well as in Kenya’s
          Masai Mara. Daily river crossings can be seen at the Mara and Talek
          rivers. The herds usually cross back to the Serengeti from the Mara
          and head towards the now fertile southern Serengeti, traveling fast
          and covering long distances in a single day. By December the herds had
          arrived in Ndutu and began calving.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-5 text-xl text-primary">
          CALVING SEASON ITINERARY DECEMBER - MARCH
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3 mt-5 text-lg text-darker/85">
          The herds congregate on the short grass plains of the southern
          Serengeti and northernmost regions of the Ngorongoro Conservation
          Area. An estimated 500,000 calves are born during a two- to three-week
          window in February. This mass calving draws a staggering number of
          predators eager to prey on the vulnerable newborns. This area also
          allows off road game drives, allowing you to explore some of the most
          untouched and rugged areas of the northern circuit. Ndutu is
          definitely a hidden gem if you're traveling during this time.
