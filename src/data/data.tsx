    category: "safari",
    qn: "WHAT EXPECTATIONS SHOULD I HAVE ON SAFARI?",
    ans: "While we work to provide our guests with exceptional comfort and luxury while on safari, it is important to remember that a safari is by definition a journey and one in a pretty harsh environment compared to a holiday in Disneyland.  For most first-time safari-goers, safety is rightly a concern. Ensure you are following your guide’s instructions and not doing anything foolish, and your safety should not be in jeopardy at all while on a safari. Expect dust, insects, noisy animals, bumpy game drives and early mornings. However, those are small discomforts when you’re surrounded by a herd of dozens of elephants right in front of your eyes.",
  },
  {
    category: "safari",
    qn: "WHAT IS THE BEST TIME OF YEAR TO GO ON SAFARI?",
    ans: "East Africa has a dry season, which is the more popular option for safari, and the green season. Safaris in the dry season generally see animals congregated at waterholes and a less dense bush, which makes spotting animals easier. The green season offers more opportunities to see animals more spread out and a beautiful and lush green bush with plenty of birds. Depending on the time of year you wish to travel we will help you design a trip that maximizes wildlife viewing.",
  },
  {
    category: "safari",
    qn: "WHEN IS THE BEST TIME OF YEAR TO VIEW THE GREAT MIGRATION?",
    ans: "The Great Migration traditionally follows the rain as animals migrate towards better pastures. Therefore, it is difficult to determine precisely when it will happen. Working on the assumption of a 'normal' year, the migration generally begins in early April, May, and June, when the calves are strong enough and the journey north begins. From June/July the wildebeest gather in the Western Corridor of the Serengeti National Park and in August/September they cross the Grumeti River and head towards the Masai Mara in Kenya. From October to December, the animals begin to move back into the Serengeti heading south into Ndutu. Here they prepare to give birth, which usually occurs at the beginning of February.",
  },
  {
    category: "safari",
    qn: "HOW IS THE BIRDING IN TANZANIA?",
    ans: "Tanzania is an excellent all-year-round birding destination. It boasts over 1000 bird species, with Lake Manyara alone being home to more than 400. Thousands of flamingos on the lake make for a spectacular sight and photographic opportunity. At the height of the northern winter, some 160 species of migrants make their way south, adding to the local birdlife.",
  },
  {
    category: "safari",
    qn: "WHAT KIND OF CLOTHING SHOULD I PACK?",
    ans: "Casual, comfortable clothing is suitable throughout the year. Due to the high altitude on the rim of Ngorongoro Crater it can be cold at night (even in summer); therefore it is very important to pack warm clothing for the nights. The most practical items to pack are:",
    list: [
      "Khaki, brown, white, green and beige colors.",
      "Light cotton tops and cotton trousers/shorts in summer",
      "Long sleeved blouses/shirts for game drives, safari trousers for evenings and cooler days",
      "A fleece or sweater and a warm jacket for game drives in the early morning(and at the Ngorongoro Crater)",
      "Swimwear is a must for the beach",
      "A hat, sunglasses and sunscreen",
      "Comfortable walking shoes",
      "For climbing Mount Kilimanjaro and Meru: Thermal underwear, light layers, sweater, warm jacket, good socks and sturdy boots.",
    ],
    note: "*Please note: brighter colours like blue or red are proven to attract insects while the tan range of colors show dirt less obviously and also do not absorb heat as much as darker colors.",
  },
  {
    category: "safari",
    qn: "ARE THERE SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS TO GET INTO TANZANIA?",
    ans: "Visitors must be vaccinated against yellow fever no less than ten days before travel to Tanzania and need to produce a Yellow Fever Vaccination Certificate at the point of entry. If you do not have one, you could be required to get an injection at the airport. If you cannot have a yellow fever injection for medical reasons, you will need to produce a doctor's letter stating these reasons. Areas of Tanzania still face issues with malaria and malaria prophylactics are highly recommended. Please consult your medical practitioner when planning your trip.",
  },
  {
    category: "safari",
    qn: "WILL THERE BE WIFI AVAILABLE?",
    ans: "Most lodging accommodations will have Wi-Fi available. It is important to note that while Wi-Fi is available in most areas, it is most likely not the speed you are used to but should be efficient enough to check email and communicate back home.",
  },
  {
    category: "safari",
    qn: "HOW MUCH SHOULD I TIP MY SAFARI GUIDE?",
    ans: `We recognize tipping isn’t customary throughout the world. We pay our guides above industry standards so that they are not reliant on tips or commissions. We believe this also allows them to focus on delivering an outstanding experience without needing to worry about tips at the end. That being said, if you’d like to give your guide a tip to appreciate a job well done - we highly encourage you to do so. A general rule of thumb is $10 USD per day per person. <a href="#">For more information on tipping in Tanzania, please visit our blog post about tipping</a>.`,

    category: "kili",
    qn: "WHAT TIME OF YEAR SHOULD I CLIMB KILIMANJARO ?",
    ans: "We have scheduled climbs year-round. If you have a particular event or day you would like to be standing on the summit; we can arrange that.  Typically the months of January-February and July - October see less precipitation on the mountain.",
  },
  {
    category: "kili",
    qn: "HOW DO I PREPARE FOR MY CLIMB UP KILIMANJARO?",
    ans: "Even if you are using the relatively 'easy' Marangu route, the high altitude (thus low oxygen supply levels), and the physical strain of the long treks still require you to be both physically and mentally ready for the challenge. You should start physically preparing for the climb at least two months before the actual climb. Regular hiking is probably the best training exercise you can undertake for climbing Mt Kilimanjaro. If you have access to hiking trails with moderate elevation, make the most out of it. It conditions your legs for the strenuous uphill and downhill climbs you will encounter on the mountain. At the very least, you should trek for one hour, two to three times a week, with more extended treks during the weekend. You can also make use of the stair master machine if you have access to a gym. Aerobic training can also enhance your body's ability to function efficiently when oxygen supply is low. Simple exercises such as cycling and running can help build your aerobic capacity. If you have access to high altitude training systems, it can help you to pre-acclimatize to high altitude, thus improving your chances for success Check out our blog post on exercises you can do to prepare for your trek!",

    ans: "We supply all necessary camping gear, including waterproof 4-season tents, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, tables and chairs, cooking gear and private portable toilet if you’ve opted for that package. You can also rent trekking poles or other gear for a small additional cost",
  },
  {
    category: "kili",
    qn: "WHAT ROUTE IS THE BEST FOR ME?",
    ans: "Which route you choose is a personal choice and will depend on many factors, including your vacation time available, budget, and personal preference. We can recommend that generally speaking, the more days you spend on the mountain, the higher the rate of a successful summit. Other things to consider when choosing a route is how scenic you’d like the trek to be and if you’d like to avoid the majority of crowds.",
  },
  {
    category: "kili",
    qn: "OKAY, BUT WHAT ROUTE DO YOU RECOMMEND?",
    ans: "Lemosho is considered the most beautiful route on Kilimanjaro and grants panoramic vistas on various sides of the mountain. It is our favorite route because it offers an outstanding balance of low traffic, scenic views, and a high summit success rate. Thus, Lemosho comes highly recommended for its great chance for acclimatization, and most of our clients use Lemosho. The Machame route is also popular for its scenically beautiful with great views and a great chance of acclimatization. However, due to the heavy crowds, it loses some of its splendor.",

  {
    category: "kili",
    qn: "WILL SAFETY EQUIPMENT BE AVAILABLE?",
    ans: "Kilimanjaro is a non-technical climb but goes to a very high altitude, so safety measures need to be taken very seriously. Our team is highly trained in high-altitude issues and recognizing and treating symptoms. They have both the skills and equipment they need to assess these issues at the moment and daily. Our support staff in the office are trained to handle these types of evacuations. \n\n Our guides always carry a first aid kit with them, and we also have a dedicated medical porter that walks with your group. We have emergency oxygen tanks on hand, as well as a stretcher. And if the condition is more serious, we do helicopter evacuations to the nearby high-altitude clinic for assessment.
