    The town of Arusha is the safari gateway to the northern parks. Arusha National Park is a 
    relatively small preserve, covering 137 sq. km. Vegetation varies greatly because of the different altitudes 
    (Mt. Meru is a 15,000 ft. peak.). Primeval forest covers parts of the crater, and there are swamps along the 
    edges of the floor. Fauna also varies greatly. The forest is home to duikers, bushbuck, buffalo and Black and 
    White Colobus Monkeys. The lakes have thousands of flamingos, as well as other aquatic birds, hippo, waterbuck, 
    reedbuck and giraffe. The areas have plentiful numbers of plains animals. Once we arrive in the park you’ll head out
     on foot on a short walking safari. After a picnic lunch you’ll do a short game drive before returning to your lodge
      for the night. Overnight Olkeri Tentend Camp
